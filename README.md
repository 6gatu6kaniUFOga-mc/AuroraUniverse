# AuroraUniverse
AuroraUniverse is a good plugin that provides a system of cities, wars, trade, countries and various ranks. A good, and most importantly confident solution for moving from Towny.
## Feauters
### Town system
Players can create towns with mayors and permission ranks. Town has many settingable functions: build, destroy, switch, fire spread, explotions, mob spawn, pvp and much more. Also towns can declare a war. Several towns can participate in it.
### Wars
Wars between cities have many features: restrictions on trade, non-aggression Pact, forced inclusion of Pvp, choice of action with the losing city (destroy, subdue, plunder).
Wars between countries represent a war between capitals, in which all the cities of the countries also participate.
The war is based on the number of points that are added up from the number of inhabitants and the volume of territory, as well as the same parameters from the allies.
### Countries
A country is an association of cities with a capital that taxes all other cities in the country.
### Market
Aurora Universe has its own custom market system that allows you to create an economy and trade between players, cities and countries. It also has the mechanics of a buyer, which players can sell things to make money on the market.
### Economy plugin
AuroraUniverse doesn't need an economic plugin, because AuroraUniverse is already one. Of course, compatible with Vault.
### Customize!
Plugin has very customisable configuration. You can set what you want!
### Safe system
Aurora Universe is a very careful and friendly plugin. It tries to track down any minor errors and let you know about them as soon as possible. Leave all the hard work to Aurora!
## Migration from Towny
Unfortunately, the plugin does not support migration from Towny, but you can transfer your server to Aurora Universe after wipe and tell the players about the new cool city system on your server.
## Where can I download plugin?
The plugin is currently under development and testing, so stay tuned to be the first to try out the new product.

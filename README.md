AuroraUniverse is a great plugin that provides a system of cities, wars, trade, countries and various ranks. A good, and most importantly confident solution for moving from Towny.

## Features
AuroraUniverse comes with great many features!  
### Towns
AuroraUniverse features a modular and fully customizable Town System.

Players can create their own Towns with Mayors and other Custom Permission Ranks. A Town has many configurable functions: Toggles for **Build**, **Destroy**, **Switch**, **Fire Spread**, **Explosion**, **Mob Spawn**, **PvP** events and many more.

### Nations
A country is an association of Towns with a capital that collects taxes all other Towns in the Nations.

### Wars
Towns can declare wars to each other. Multiple towns can participate in a war.

Wars come with several features: 
- Restrictions on Trade
- Non-aggression Pact
- Forced inclusion in PvP
- Chose what happens to the defeated Town: (Destroy, Subdue or Plunder.)

Wars between Nations represent a war between the Capital Towns, in which all Towns from the opposing Nations can choose to participate in.
A war is based on the number of points that are added up from the number of inhabitants and the volume of territory, as well as the same parameters from the allies.
### Universal Market
AuroraUniverse has its own custom market system that allows you to create a player-driven economy and support trade between Players, Towns and Countries. It also has a buyer mechanic, which allows Players to sell things on the Market to make themselves some money..
### Built-in Economy
AuroraUniverse does not need an economy plugin, because AuroraUniverse is already one. Of course, compatible with Vault.
### Customizable
AuroraUniverse is configurable! You can configure everything to your liking!
### Safety Measures
Aurora Universe is a very careful and user-friendly plugin. It tries to track down any minor error and lets you know about them as soon as possible. 
Leave all the hard work to Aurora!
## Migrating from Towny
Unfortunately, AuroraUniverse does not support migration from Towny. However, you can transfer your server to Aurora Universe after a wipe and tell the players about the new cool Town System on your server!
## Where can I download the plugin?
The plugin is currently under development and a testing process. Stay tuned to be the first to try out the new product!
## Wiki
The wiki can be found [here](https://github.com/AuroraUniverse/AuroraUniverse/wiki)

## Dependencies 
This plugin requires [EPCAPI](https://github.com/karlovm/EasyPluginCore/tree/0.4) to work properly.
You will also need Vault if you are using the economy functions.
